![Manage Users](/images/Manage_Users.png)
Select a user from the dropdown menu and you can assign the user to a group. You can also deactivate the user which will keep the account but not allow the user to log in. Or you can delete the user which will delete their account completely. 

If the user was created by logging in via SSO, they will still be able to log in once they have been deleted. But they will have no permissions and won't be assigned to a group so will not have access to any productions. 

You can enable the ability for users to scan or start a production transcoder. They will only be able to scan or transcode the productions they have access to. 

Clicking on the number beside their name at the top will enter the impersonation for this user. This is useful if you need to check a user has the correct permissions. 

You can add a local user by clicking the blue + button at the top. 

This will bring up the new user modal. Add the required information and click submit. The user will be sent an email with their new account details and they will have been addd to the system. You can now add them to any groups they require.
