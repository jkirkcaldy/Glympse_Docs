Glympse uses groups to allocate permissions for productions. When you create a new Base Production a new group of the same name is created. For users to be able to access any project they will need to be added to the Base Production group. 

From there they will be able to access any Production assigned to a Base Production automatically. 

It is possible to create your own groups and assign one or more Base Productions to a group. This is useful for people who may be working across multiple productions. 

There are some managment/admin groups that are created automatically and these groups have permissions to view all productions.
