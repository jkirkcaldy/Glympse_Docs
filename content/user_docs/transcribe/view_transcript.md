The file will play on the left and the transcript is displayed on the right. You can click on a timecode in the transcript to navigate to that part of the video/audio file. 

You can also edit any of the text by clicking on it and making your edits. 

If you have made any edits, you can save them by clicking the file menu and clicking `Save`. 
## File menu
From the file menu you can also rename your file or exit the page. 

You can also change the vberbosity from here too. Schanging the verbosity changes how often the timecodes appear in your transcript. This is useful if you woudl rather have larger chunks of text for each timecode. 

The below example is a transcript with a much lower verbosity.
