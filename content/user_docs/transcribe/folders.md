By default when you transcribe a file, they will be in the root of the transcript table. This may be preferable when there are one or two files transcribed, but once you start to get more and more transcripts, you may want to organise the files into subdirectories or folders. 

To add a folder click the New Folder button and enter a name for the folder.

![New folder](/images/review_new_folder_name.png)

This will be added to the Home page, you can drag files into this folder, alternatively, if you enter a folder and then click upload, it will upload the file directly to this folder.

When you drag a file into a folder, the row of the folder you have selected will be highlighted green, release the file and it wil be added to this folder. 

Alternatively you can use the menu for each folder or item to move files. 

Click the dropdown menu button for the file or menu you wish to move and select Move.
