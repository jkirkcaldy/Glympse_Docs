It is possible to upload a file to be transcribed. This can be an audio or video file and does not need to belong to an existing production.

Navigate to the Transcribe page and click upload.

### Title *Required*
Enter a title for your clip. This is how the clip will appear within Glympse. 

### Roll
*Optional* Enter the camera/audio roll if you have one. This is optional but, if supplied, will appear in the title of the transcript. 

### Format
The only option here is Word Doc, though you can download a subtitle file or an avid ScriptSync file from the transcript page.

### Shooter
*Optional* Add the name of the shooter.

### Date
*Optional* Enter the creation/shoot date of the file. 

### Frame Rate
*Optional* Glympse will try to automatically get the framerate from the file, if you're uploading a video file, enter the framerate here so the timecodes will be accurate. 

#### Timecode
*Optional* Glympse will try get the timecode from the file. If you wish to enter a different timecode or if you're uploading an audio file without timecode, entering a timecode here will calculate all the timecodes in the transcript from this starting timecode. 

### Translate
If checked, Glympse will attempt to translate the file to English. This is for foreign audio files, it doesn't work if the main content is English and there is a sentence or two in a foreign language.

### Verbosity
This is how often the timecodes are injected in the transcript. It is possible to change this later in the transcript page. 

### File
Select your file.
