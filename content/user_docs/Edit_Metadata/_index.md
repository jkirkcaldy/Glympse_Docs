It is possible to edit some of the metadata for the clips within Glympse. 

Any metadata changes apply only to the Glympse database and are not carried over to the clips themselves. 


To edit the metadata of the clips, click "Edit Clips" in the top right. This will look like the home page where you can select your production. 
Click the Edit button to edit the clip metadata.
