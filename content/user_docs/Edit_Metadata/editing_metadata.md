There are limited options for editing the metadata. You can edit only the roll, the date and the shooter aswell as hide or unhide a clip. 

To edit a clip select it by checking the checkbox of the clip row. At the bottom of the table you can enter a new roll/date/shooter then click save to save the edits. 

Whatever you entered in all three boxes will be applied to the selected clips. Leave the box empty to leave the current details unchanged. 

You can also hide/unhide clips by checking the hide checkbox. As soon as you click the checkbox it will be immediately hidden. It is possible that the clips may still appear until the cache has ben flushed. This process can take 10-15 minutes.


From this page you can also send multiple clips to the transcription engine. 

Select the clips by checking the checkbox and click transcribe. This w3ill send the selected clips to be transcribed. 

You can also delete clips from the Glympse database. 

Glympse has read only access to the raw camera files, by deleting clips from Glympse, the original camera files will be unaffected.
