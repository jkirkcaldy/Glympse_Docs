It is posible to share the review file to anyone who is in the production group by simply copying the link from the browser. 

If you want to share a link with someone who doesn't have access or is not a Glympse user, you will need to create a link using the share dialogue. 

From the video review page, click share in the menu bar, then `generate share link`

This will show you all the links for this file as well as the internal link that can be shared with Glympse users.
