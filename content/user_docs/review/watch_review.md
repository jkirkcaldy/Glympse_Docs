When you click on a file title from the review page, you will be taken the file viewing page. The viewing experience is similar to that of watching rushes, however with review files, multiple qualities are created. This allows for higher resolution viewing of a file. 

It is also possible for anyone with download access to download the original file. Download access is given to all users in the production group or is specifically given when creating a download link.

You can play the video file and add markers as you watch. 

## Add Markers
Whilst the video is playing, you can add a marker by clicking in the box that says "Enter your notes here". This will pause the video whilst you add your text.

You can change the type of marker by pressing the change marker button: 
![Change Marker](/images/change_marker_type_btn.png)

This will bring up a menu with the available marker types. Select the type you want to add and the marker button will change colour.

When you have entered your text in the box, click the save button or press `enter`
![blur marker](/images/blur_marker.png)

The marker will be added to the right hand side of the video player. 
![Markers](/images/markers.png)

Any markers added by you or others will appear here. MArkers will be added live if there are others reviewing the file at the same time. 

Clicking on the timecode of the marker will navigate the player to that timecode. 

It is also possible to change the marker type after it has been added. The process is the same, click the change marker type button on the marker itself and select a new marker type.

If you added the marker, it's also possible to change the marker text. It is also only possible for the person who added a marker to delete it. 

Hover over the marker and the delete button will appear. 
![delete marker](/images/delete_marker.png)

You can reply to any marker by pressing the reply button on a marker. This will allow you to add a reply to the markers. 
![add note](/images/add_note.png)

Again, only the person who adds the note can delete it. Unless the marker it's applied to is deleted by someone else.
